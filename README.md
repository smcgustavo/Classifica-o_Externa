# External Sorting 
External Sorting is an algorithm implementation to sort data structures on disk when the RAM is not big enough to acommodate all the data. It uses a strategy where it sorts some amount of data into the disk in many files, then, starts assembling again all the files into one by picking the lowest or highest id from any file.
